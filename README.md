1. Purpose of the Project
	The proposed system aims to predict the Human Activity by using LSTM Deep Neural Networks.This project is designed to recognize human activites: Walking, Standing, Sitting, Laying, Going Upstairs, Going Downstairs using data collected by the sensors accelerometer and gyroscope.

2. Software files
	In this project we need NumPy,pandas,sikit-learn,TensorFlow,Keras,Jupyter Notebook and flask.We need to install NumPy,pandas,sikit-learn,TensorFlow and flask in your system before starting up with the project.We also install Anaconda to work with Jupyter Notebook to develop the Deep Learning Model.

3. Project files

5. Project Execution Steps
Step 1 : Run the deep learning code in jupyter notebook
Step 2 : Save the front end code
Step 3 : Open the command promt
Step 4 : Set the path to front end code
Step 5 : Run the code using python app.py command
Step 6 : An url will be generated
Step 7 : Copy and paste it in browser and webpage will be opened. 
Step 8 : Enter 7 input values in the webpage and click submit
Step 9 : The result will be displayed in the webpage.
